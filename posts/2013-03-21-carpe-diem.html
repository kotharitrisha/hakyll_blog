<p>Once, a few wise men appeared at the court of a rich king, and claimed that they are the wisest men on the planet. The king decided to test their wisdom, and asked them to compile a book with all the knowledge of the world.</p>
<p>After days of effort, the wise men reappeared and presented the book to the king.</p>
<p>The king asked them to condense it further to a chapter.</p>
<p>After weeks of toil, they appeared again at the court, proud of their accomplishments.</p>
<p>The king was still not impressed. He asked them to reduce it to a page.</p>
<p>Months of sweat and blood led to the wise men presenting the page containing all the wisdom of the world.</p>
<p>The king was happy (I mean, if you can get all the knowledge of the world in a page, you better be happy!) However, to prove that they were the wisest men on the planet, they had to do more than any man could do.</p>
<p>The king asked them to present all the knowledge of the world in a sentence.</p>
<p>The men were astonished. (After all, is he so lazy that he can’t even read a page!?)</p>
<p>They accepted the challenge, and after a few years, returned to the court.</p>
<p>They handed the king a paper containing the wisdom of the world:</p>
<p>“And this too shall pass.”</p>
